# HelloWorld-Smart-Contract

This is my first smart contract written in **Solidity** as part of my Web3 learning journey.  
The goal of this project is to understand the basics of smart contracts and start building consistently on GitHub.

## 🚀 What This Contract Does
- Stores a message on the blockchain
- Initializes the message with "Hello, Web3!"
- Allows anyone to update the message using a public function

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Solidity
- Remix IDE (browser-based Ethereum IDE)

## 🧪 How to Run / Test
1. Open [https://remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org)
2. Create a new file named `HelloWorld.sol`
3. Paste the contract code
4. Compile using Solidity version `0.8.x`
5. Deploy the contract
6. Call the `message()` function to read the value
7. Call `updateMessage()` to change the stored message

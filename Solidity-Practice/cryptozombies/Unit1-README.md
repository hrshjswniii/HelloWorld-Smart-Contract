# CryptoZombies – Unit 1 (Solidity Basics)

This folder contains my progress from Unit 1 of CryptoZombies, where I am learning the fundamentals of Solidity.

All concepts are implemented incrementally in a single contract file: `ZombieFactory.sol`.

## 📘 Concepts Covered (Chapters 1–5)

 1. Smart Contract Structure
- Solidity version declaration using `pragma`
- Basic contract definition

 2. State Variables
- Declaring state variables
- Understanding how data is stored on-chain

 3. Data Types
- Usage of `uint` (unsigned integers)
- Understanding value ranges and defaults

 4. Structs
- Defining custom data structures using `struct`
- Creating a `Zombie` struct with:
  - `name`
  - `dna`

 5. Arrays
- Declaring dynamic arrays
- Storing multiple `Zombie` structs in an array
- Understanding how arrays are used to manage collections of data


 🎯 Goal of This Unit
The goal of Unit 1 is to build a strong foundation in Solidity by:
- Learning how data is structured and stored
- Understanding how smart contracts manage collections
- Preparing for more advanced concepts like mappings, functions, and modifiers in later chapters

 🚧 Progress Status
- ✅ Chapters 1–5: Completed (Structs & Arrays)
- 🔄 Chapters 6–15: In progress
